This is a gesture recognition project using the Kinect, written in C++. It is based on kinecgest project from http://github.com/fyhuang/kinectgest/

# Basic usage

After compiling FreeStroke and KController, run KController on a Windows environement after installing the Kinect SDK 1.6, then start FreeStroke.

# Compiling

- KController 

There are two version of the KController, one in C++ using a Win32 project and another in C#.

You must install the Kinect SDK 1.6 from Microsoft before compiling any KController project.

We used Visual Studio 2012 ultimate to compile the code.

You must install Qt 4.8 to compile the project.

If you're on Windows open the file FreeStroke/project/Win32 and setup the compile location on this directory.
If you're on OSX open the file FreeStroke/project/mac and setup the compile location on this directory.
If you're on Linux open the file FreeStroke/project/linux and setup the compile location on this directory.

FreeStroke can be run on Windows, OSX and Linux.

Both controller must be run on Windows because of the Kinect SDK.
